# MLBench
- Test **sustained** Neural Engine performance, natively
- Uses a relevant `ResNet50Int8LUT` model for max throughput
- Runnable from the DMG, doesn't make any files in Application Support
- Works on an CoreML executor (ANE, Intel iGPU, whatever else)
- A more detailed description coming soon (?)
